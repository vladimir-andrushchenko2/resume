    <h3 class="section-header">About me:</h3>
    <p>
      As&nbsp;a&nbsp;highly sociable individual, I&nbsp;thoroughly enjoy working with people and learning about
      different cultures. My
      passion for exploring new cultures has led me&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit 22&nbsp;countries, and&nbsp;I have even lived
      in&nbsp;France, Germany, and
      China, where&nbsp;I learned to&nbsp;pursue my&nbsp;dream of&nbsp;opening a&nbsp;foreign language school. One
      of&nbsp;the greatest joys in&nbsp;my
      life is&nbsp;the diverse group of&nbsp;friends&nbsp;I have from all around the world.
      I&nbsp;enjoy hiking in&nbsp;nature and challenging myself both physically and mentally. I&nbsp;am fortunate
      to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;life with
      a&nbsp;wonderful wife who supports my&nbsp;passions and is&nbsp;my&nbsp;partner in&nbsp;all my&nbsp;adventures.
